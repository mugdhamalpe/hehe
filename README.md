Adding a chatbot feature to Data Lens aims to enhance the self-service capacity of users, providing immediate access to necessary information or data. This AI-powered functionality can facilitate deeper insights, aid in decision-making, and enable the automated extraction of data, tailored to the user's specific interest.

Moreover, the Data Lens chatbot could serve as a knowledge base, responding to internal queries regarding the onboarding process or the usage of Data Lens. This feature optimizes efficiency by providing swift responses to end users, addressing their need for data extracts or specific information.

For recurring needs such as KYC checks or sanctions screenings, the chatbot proves particularly useful. It can efficiently supply detailed information about open or active trades associated with specific counterparties, serving a variety of users from diverse business streams. As such, the Data Lens chatbot is a strategic addition that amplifies the platform's utility and increases its value to end users.

The proposed chatbot integration with Data Lens has the potential to streamline operations, particularly by reducing the repetitive burden placed on the technology team. Currently, Data Lens handles approximately four to five business data extract requests per week, each consuming between 15 minutes to 2 hours of manual effort. Additionally, the platform receives daily user queries related to data usage, logic, and various other topics, each requiring five to thirty minutes of attention.

With the implementation of a chatbot, we anticipate substantial improvements in efficiency and user experience:

1. The self-service capabilities of Data Lens users will be significantly enhanced. Users will be able to quickly find answers to common queries without the need for technical intervention.

2. Answers provided by the chatbot will be more specific, moving away from generic information found in Confluence to precise, context-aware responses.

3. Users will have easier access to the right data at the right time, bypassing the wait times usually associated with IT SME engagement.

Our initial estimation suggests that the introduction of the chatbot feature could significantly reduce the volume of queries addressed to IT and Business teams. We anticipate that this could result in savings of up to 20 man hours per week for IT resources and between 2 to 4 man hours per week for Business resources. 

By doing so, the Data Lens chatbot will not only streamline operations but also free up critical resources to focus on higher-value tasks and projects, thereby contributing to overall business growth and efficiency.
