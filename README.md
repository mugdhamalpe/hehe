Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed colleagues,

I stand before you today, at the culmination of an enriching journey as an intern at Barclays, feeling a sense of profound gratitude and achievement. My time here has been an incredible learning experience, a period of growth both personally and professionally.

My primary project during this internship revolved around DataLens, an initiative that required the development of a chatbot. I found myself delving into the intricate workings of the project, learning not just about the technology that drives it, but the real-world impact it can have. I was tasked with creating workflows for static as well as dynamic use cases, and developing a user-defined function in Redshift for the calculation of network days - challenges that allowed me to apply my technical knowledge in meaningful ways.

My journey started with building a basic FAQ bot. It was a hands-on experience where I framed questionnaires, trained the bot, and refined its structure, all the while gaining an appreciation for the intricate details of chatbot development. As I progressed, I identified dynamic use cases that involved data extraction. I learned that every question the chatbot answered, every interaction it facilitated, was a small yet significant step towards enhancing user experience.

In our quest to create an effective chatbot, we sought the guidance of the Bot Factory team. Their expertise was instrumental in reviewing workflows and training the chatbot. They also aided in implementing the 'action trades' feature, where an SDS ID and a SharePoint link were provided to the user for data viewing - a functionality that markedly improved our botâ€™s utility.

Later in my journey, the project expanded to include the creation of an API for data extraction. Here, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my team member, Harish, who was an incredible support throughout this process. His invaluable help and patient mentorship made the complex task seem achievable.

However, none of this would have been possible without the constant guidance and patient mentoring from my line manager. His unwavering faith in our abilities, coupled with his clear vision and teaching, greatly contributed to our success. 

I have learned an immense amount during this journey, and every day has been a step forward, both in terms of my knowledge and my confidence. I am honoured to have had the opportunity to contribute to Barclays' innovative endeavours. 

As I look towards my future, I am inspired by the lessons learned and the experiences shared during this internship. Barclays has equipped me with more than just technical skills; it has instilled in me a sense of purpose and a deeper understanding of the impact technology can have in the financial industry.

I stand before you today, more prepared and more excited for the future than ever before. This is not a conclusion but the start of a new chapter, a journey I am eager to continue. Thank you, Barclays, for the opportunities, for the lessons, and for the incredible journey.

Thank you.
