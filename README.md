Subject: Resignation - Health and Work Constraints

Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. It is with a heavy heart that I write to tender my resignation from my internship at [Company Name], effective [last working day, typically two weeks from the date of the resignation letter].

I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here and appreciate the opportunities for professional growth that the internship has provided. However, a combination of factors has led me to this difficult decision.

Firstly, I have been grappling with significant mental stress, attempting to balance the demands of my health and work. Unfortunately, my recent health reports have confirmed that my health is deteriorating, with frequent migraine headaches, anxiety attacks, and a drastic increase in TSH values for thyroid issues. Regrettably, these health challenges have made it increasingly difficult for me to meet the demands of the internship effectively.

Secondly, when I initially joined, I was under the impression that the internship would be fully remote, as communicated by the HR department. However, given the current circumstances and my health conditions, I find myself unable to participate in a hybrid work model that requires me to be present in the office. This unforeseen change has further contributed to the strain on my health and well-being.

Considering these factors and after careful consideration, I believe it is in the best interest of both parties for me to step down from my internship role. I am grateful for the support and understanding from the team during my time here, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience my decision may cause.

I would like to express my gratitude for the learning experiences and opportunities for growth that I have gained during my time at [Company Name]. I hope to maintain a positive connection with the team and the organization in the future.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]
